# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is a personal portfolio with minimal security risks. However, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting me directly:

- open a private GitHub issue (please mention it is a security-related concern).

Please do **not** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## Response

I will acknowledge security reports within 48 hours and work to resolve any confirmed issues promptly.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
