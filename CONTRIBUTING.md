# Contributing to My Portfolio

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This site is a personal portfolio built with GitHub Pages to showcase my projects. While I generally maintain the content myself, I welcome the following types of contributions:

- Bug reports or suggestions for improving the site
- Ideas for new features or portfolio sections
- Corrections for typos or factual errors

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
3. Open a pull request (PR) with a summary of your changes.

Iâ€™ll review all pull requests, but please note that contributions may be merged or declined based on whether they fit the scope and style of this portfolio.

## Issues & Suggestions

If you notice a bug or want to suggest a new feature or improvement, please open an issue using the appropriate template (if available), or just describe your idea clearly.

## Code Style

- Keep HTML/CSS/JS clean and readable.
- Provide short but helpful comments if needed.
- For larger suggestions, open an issue first to discuss.
